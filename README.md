# MiniC-Compiler

This program was the final program in college compiler course. I mainly used C to build the skeleton of this program, but there were some usages of C++ envolved. The compiler can recognize if-else, while statements and support two data types: int and char. The compiler does not convert C into assembly codes but execute the input file and print the results with 'printf'.
